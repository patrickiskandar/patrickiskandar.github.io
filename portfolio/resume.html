        I am a recent graduate from McGill University, with a BA in computer
        science and a minor in political science. CS focus on statistical
        programing, Machine Learning, and Database management. I have a robust
        Mathematics and Statistics proficiency and work well in collaborative
        environments.

    Projects
</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Handwritten Digits Recognition</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Implemented a deep neural network model, more specifically a
        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for a multi-label classification
        task. Given an MNIST dataset consisting of images which contain between
        1 to 5 handwritten digits, the model was trained using automatic
        differentiation to recognize the depicted digits. The model yielded an
        accuracy of approximately 99.62%
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>
        Hospital Database and Application Programming Using PostgreSQL and Java
        Database Connectivity
    </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Using dummy data, I created a database application to keep track of
        COVID patients, contact cases, patient status and six other data
        factors. The application provided a user interface to enable data
        entry, query, and modification using PostgreSQL and Java Database
        Connectivity (JDBC)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>
        COVID-19 Predicting Hospitalization Rates and Visualizing Search Trends
    </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Employed two regression models (K-nearest neighbors and decision trees)
        using Covid-19 databases, to predict hospitalization rates from related
        Google search data
    </li>
    <li>
        Visualized the search frequency of the most popular symptoms throughout
        the US over time using various Python libraries
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NBA Shot Data Visualization</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Created a Python program that prompts user for a name of an NBA player
        and a season (after 1996), and returns a scatter plot visualization of
        where every shot by that player for that season was taken from on the
        court, as well as whether the shot went in or not
    </li>
    <li>
        Data was scraped from basketball-reference.com using Selenium, and data
        extraction and visualization was done using pandas and seaborn Python
        libraries
    </li>
</ul>
